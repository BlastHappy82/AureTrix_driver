Dynamic Keystroke (DKS): This feature allows you to assign up to four different actions to a single key, triggered at various points of a single press and release cycle (e.g., press start, bottom out, release start, full release). This is often used in games to enable actions like walking with a light press and sprinting with a deep press on the same key.
Multi-Point Trigger (MPT): Similar to DKS, MPT (or Multi-action Keystroke) allows you to set multiple, distinct actuation points within a single key's travel, with each point triggering a different action. This provides layered inputs and enhanced control without needing extra keys or complex macros.
Toggle (TGL): This function transforms a key into a switch that stays "on" after one press and turns "off" after a second press. Instead of holding down a key (like a sprint button), you tap it once to activate the function continuously and tap it again to deactivate it, which is ideal for managing persistent actions.
End: The term "end" or "endgame" is less a specific function of Hall Effect keyboards and more a term used within the broader keyboard community to describe a user's ideal keyboard setup—one that is so perfect for their needs that they feel they have "ended" their search for better gear. It is not a software feature to be programmed.
SOCD: Stands for Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions (cleaner). This feature defines how the keyboard handles conflicting directional inputs pressed at the same time (e.g., pressing both "Left" and "Right" in a game). An SOCD cleaner applies specific rules (like prioritizing the last input, or canceling both) to ensure valid, consistent input, which is particularly useful in fighting games and rhythm games.
Macro: This function allows you to record a sequence of multiple key presses, clicks, and delays and bind the entire sequence to a single key. Pressing that key then executes the entire string of commands automatically, which is a powerful tool for automating complex or repetitive tasks.
